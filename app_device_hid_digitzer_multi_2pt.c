/********************************************************************
To use this demo, program a device with the firmware from this project.
Then plug the device into a Windows 7 or Windows Vista SP1+ based PC.

MSDN documentation for the "WM_GESTURE" messages indicate that they are
currently only supported in Windows 7.  WM_GESTURE messages can be used
by PC applications to receive information related to a user's input.  
However, Windows Vista SP1 still has some digitizer input 
capabilities, and can therefore still be used to experiment with this demo.
The demo experience will be superior under Windows 7 however, as not
all touch related capabilities and features are enabled in Windows Vista.

The device should enumerate as a HID class multi-touch capable
digitizer device.  Windows 7 and Windows Vista features associated 
with "Windows Touch" should automatically become activated.  
Under default versions of Windows XP, the device should still enumerate 
as a HID class device, but no new digitizer input functionality will 
be activated.

Digitizer tablets send absolute contact position information
to the host.  This is a bit different compared to conventional mouse
devices, in that mice send relative X/Y direction movement information,
instead of an absolute location.

Since the demo boards that this firmware is intended to be run on
do not include an actual multi-touch tablet area, the firmware simply
emulates the tablet by sending the same data (and formatting) that a tablet
would actually be used to produce.  The demo board pushbutton "sw3"
(see definition in the HardwareProfile - (board name).h file)
can be used to make the demo board send simulated gesture info to the host.

To use this demo, open up an Internet Explorer window, and go to some website 
(ex: www.microchip.com/usb).
The web page opened should be large enough that both vertical and 
horizontal scrollbars will become active when zoomed in. Click on some 
link, and then click the back button.  The purpose of this is to enable both 
the forward and back buttons in the web broswer.  
This demo will send gesture information to the OS that can be interpreted as 
forward and back "flick" gestures, which can be used to control the web browser.

Now try pressing the pushbutton on the demo board repeatedly.  Each press
of the pushbutton should send a bunch of IN packets to the host, which contain
the information that would typically be generated by a human user interacting 
with a multi-touch capable digitizer screen.

The firmware will send traffic to emulate both single touch and multi-touch 
(up to 2 simultaneous contacts) gestures, based on the number of times the
pushbutton has been pressed.  Under Windows 7 (Vista will be somewhat different),
the following gestures will be sent and should be recognized by Internet Explorer:

1.  Emulate a single touch "back" gesture operation.  
		This is done by pressing only one finger down, and by moving it right quickly (X plus)
2.  Emulate a single touch "forward" gesture operation.  
		This is done by pressing only one finger down, and by moving it left quickly (X minus)
3.  Emulate a multi-touch zoom-in operation ("un-pinch" index and thumb fingers)
4.  Emulate a multi-touch zoom-in operation ("un-pinch" index and thumb fingers)
5.  Emulate a multi-touch zoom-in operation ("un-pinch" index and thumb fingers)
6.  Emulate a multi-touch horizontal scroll right operation 
      This is done by using two fingers simultaneously and moving them both to the left (X minus)
7.  Emulate a multi-touch horizontal scroll left operation
      This is done by using two fingers simultaneously and moving them both to the right (X plus)
8.  Emulate a single touch scroll down operation.  
      This is done by pressing only one finger down, and by moving it down (Y plus)
9.  Emulate a single touch scroll up operation.  
      This is done by pressing only one finger down, and by moving it up (Y minus)
10. Emulate a multi-touch zoom-out operation (pinch two fingers together)

11+. Upon pressing the button 11 times, the firmware will go back to state 1. Subsequent 
       presses of the button will step through and repeat the above gestures 1-10.

Note: The above demo zooms in three times in a row (presses 3-5).  The purpose of this
is to zoom in sufficiently so that the horizontal and vertical scoll bars will become
active.  The gestures associated with button presses 6-9 perform scroll operations,
but only if the scroll bars are active.

Note2: This demo was tested and developed primarily on 64-bit Windows 7 beta build 7000, 
with some additional testing on Windows Vista SP1.  At the time of this development,
Windows 7 is not yet a finalized and released product.  If you have trouble getting
this demo to work correctly, check to see if there is a later version of this demo
available from the Microchip USB design center: www.microchip.com/usb

Additionally, try adjusting some of the user adjustable controls for 
Pen and Touch Input Devices.  These adjustments can be found from the control panel 
within Windows.


This demo is configured by default to support up to two simultaneous contacts,
by using "parallel reporting" (all data for each contact is contained in each
HID report packet sent to the host).  The demo can be modified to support additional
contacts if the report descriptor in usb_config.h is modified, and the appropriate
contact data is sent to the host for each HID report.

 *          the MULTI_TOUCH_DIGITIZER_MODE. By default however, it is best
 *          if the device powers up with some other default mode (mouse mode
 *          or single-touch digizer), so as to provide improved functionality
 *          on legacy operating systems (that don't support multi-touch
 *          digitizers, and would not know how to interpret/use the reports).
 *
 *
 * Note:    Reports of data should be sent to the host matching the Report
 *          Descriptor and the current DeviceMode.
 *          The HID report (IN) packets sent to the host should be formatted like the
 *          report descriptor in the usb_descriptors.c file.  See the usb_descriptors.c
 *          file for additional comments.  For this demo, we use the following report
 *          format:
 *
 *	//Report format for use in multi-touch device mode, which can support up to two
 *	//simultaneous contacts, using the report descriptor provided in usb_descriptors.c:
 *
 *	//Byte[0] = Report ID == use literal value = MULTI_TOUCH_DATA_REPORT_ID when sending contact reports.
 * 	//First contact point info in bytes 1-6.
 *	//Byte[1] = Bits7-2: pad bits (unused), Bit1:In Range, Bit0:Tip Switch
 *	//Byte[2] = Contact identifier number (assigned by firmware, see report descriptor)
 *	//Byte[3] = X-coordinate LSB
 *	//Byte[4] = X-coordinate MSB
 *	//Byte[5] = Y-coordinate LSB
 *	//Byte[6] = Y-coordinate MSB
 *
 *	//Second contact point info in bytes 7-12
 *	//Byte[7] = Bits7-2: pad bits (unused), Bit1:In Range, Bit0:Tip Switch
 *	//Byte[8] = Contact identifier number (assigned by firmware, see report descriptor)
 *	//Byte[9] = X-coordinate LSB
 *	//Byte[10]= X-coordinate MSB
 *	//Byte[11]= Y-coordinate LSB
 *	//Byte[12]= Y-coordinate MSB
 *
 *	//Contacts valid
 *	//Byte[13]= 8-bit number indicating how many of the above contact points are valid.
 *          If only the first contact is valid, report "1" here.  If both are
 *          valid, report "2".
 *
 *	When operating in the DeviceMode == SINGLE_TOUCH_DIGITIZER_MODE
 *	The input data reports are different.  In this mode, the device should only keep
 *	track of and send information to the host for the first contact point.  In this
 *	mode, the report sent to the host should be formatted as:
 *	//byte[0] = Report ID = SINGLE_TOUCH_DATA_REPORT_ID
 *	//byte[1] = contains bit fields for various input information typically generated by an input pen or human finger. '1' is the active value (ex: pressed), '0' is the non active value
 *	//		bit0 = Tip switch. At the end of a pen input device would normally be a pressure senstive switch.  Asserting this performs an operation analogous to a "left click" on a mouse
 *	//		bit2 = In range indicator.
 *	//		bit3 though bit 7 = Pad bits.  Values not used for anything.
 *	//byte[2] = Pad byte.  Value not used for anything.
 *	//byte[3] = X coordinate LSB value of contact point
 *	//byte[4] = X coordinate MSB value of contact point
 *	//byte[5] = Y coordinate LSB value of contact point
 *	//byte[6] = Y coordinate MSB value of contact point

 * Overview:    UserSetReportHandler() is used to respond to
 *              the HID device class specific SET_REPORT control
 *              transfer request (starts with SETUP packet on EP0 OUT).
 *
 *              This get report handler callback function is placed
 *              here instead of in usb_function_hid.c, since this code
 *              is "custom" and needs to be specific to this particular
 *              application example.  For this HID digitizer device, which
 *              supports multiple device modes, we need to be able to
 *              correctly respond to SET_FEATURE requests.  The proper response
 *              to this type of request depends on the HID report descriptor (in
 *              usb_descriptors.c).
